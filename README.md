# irrigation-data
Data from soil humidity sensor adafruit bme280 sensor; in addition, programs to retrieve data.

With this repository I will somehow publish data from a soil moisture sensor (Gies-O-Mat; https://www.ramser-elektro.at/shop/bausaetze-und-platinen/giesomat-kapazitiver-bodenfeuchtesensor-erdfeuchtesensor-mit-beschichtung/); the values will be in Hz; The first line will describe the environment where the values are taken from. One file for one run.

This data will be later on used for the data-learning project/library.

Please inform me when you want to publish data.

Best regards,
Lars Hahn
